*Style Conventions*

  1) All the code I write (except for some python) uses 2 spaces for indentation, so don't touch the tab button unless it's set up to enter a double space.
  2) Use camelCase (with lower case first letter) for naming all things in JS (with the execption of some keys that are more readable without it)
  3) IDs and Classes (CSS) use "-" instead of space and all lower case
  4) Not much else
  
You don't really have to follow these but if you edit the code it will end up a mess if styles are mixed.
