          Yes I should have used proper class based abstraction but that would be more
          effort and would produce no benifits in this case =P. Call me a lazy programmer
          if you must but it took a lot less time this way so I'll call it "efficient" XD

Tonight the sky is completely clear, and the moon hangs brightly just above the rooftops. It is a perfect night for stargazing.</p><p>He can see constellations such as Sagittarius, but he was never one for astrology. The moon amazed him, as it never stopped on its orbit. Peter knew the orbit took around a month, as he often tracked the phases in his notebook.He sits at the window for hours every night, until his eyes began to ache and get heavy.

The show doesn't involve animals, just people doing acrobatics, magic and moderately impressive stunts. They didn’t perform every weekend, so there were gaps.</p><p>In one of the shows, an acrobat broke her leg when part of the stage collapsed. The rigger that erected the stage wasn’t told that extra bracing was required near the part of the stage where she would be landing after jumping through a flaming hoop, a new section of the show.

After a few years, they became extinct.</p><p>Millions of years after this unfortunate event, a small group of earthlings visited the ruined settlement and found what the invaders had left behind. They found books and medicines that the thieves thought were worthless, with further investigation upon returning to earth, they found that these medicines were very useful to humans and not just aliens.

For many years, the bridge stood there, in weather-beaten disrepair.</p><p>Until one year a young boy came and stood upon the bridge. The child was young, full of life and fun. And, in years yet to come, the boy would return, to sit upon the bridge and gaze out at the world. But then, one day, the child did not return. The bridge stood alone, lost in the woodland once more, never to be found again. I have no doubt it remains and I hope to find it one day.
